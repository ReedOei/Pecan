# Pecan

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ReedOei/Pecan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ReedOei/Pecan)

Pecan is an automated theorem prover for BÃ¼chi automata, with additional features for making it easier to deal with expressing numbers in various numeration systems and working with automatic words.

## Installation

You will need Python 3.3 or higher.

Then, install [spot](https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/install.html), if you are on a Linux system, the `install-spot.sh` script may work for you:

```bash
bash install-spot.sh
```

Otherwise, follow the instructions on the spot website.

You will also need to install the libraries in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
# Use the appropriate line for your pip installation (if pip --version says 3.x, then you should be good; otherwise use/install pip3)
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

Below `has_zeros` and `all_ones` are expressed as [LTL formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic).

```
has_zeros(a) := "!(Ga)"
all_ones(a) := "Ga"

prop_true() := forall x. has_zeros(x) => (not all_ones(x))
#assert_prop(true, prop_true)

prop_false() := exists x. has_zeros(x) & all_ones(x)
#assert_prop(false, prop_false)
```

## Configuration

The `PECAN_PATH` environment variable controls which paths are searched for files when importing/loading automata.
It should be a colon-separated or semicolon-separated list of paths, depending on your operating system (Linux/MacOs uses `:`, Windows uses `;`).
