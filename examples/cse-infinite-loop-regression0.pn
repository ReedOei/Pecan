Restrict a, x, y, z are nat.

// Note that while it seems like this should be false, it is, in fact, true, because of how subtraction interacts weirdly with natural numbers (i.e., we can't do 0-5)
Theorem ("Test", {
    exists x,y. x - y != x + (-y)
}).

// But for ints, we get the expected result

Restrict m,n are int.
Theorem ("Test (int)", {
    forall m,n. m - n = m + (-n)
}).
